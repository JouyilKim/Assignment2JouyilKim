                <h2>About Music Shop</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                    Recognizing that New Zealand lacked a true nationwide retail music chain, two of the oldest and respected musical wholesale companies merged to form MusicWorks in 2001. We then set about selecting the best independently owned music retailers throughout the country to join our 12 company owned retail stores and 20 affiliate dealers to form the the MusicWorks retail chain that encompasses 32 specialist stores throughout New Zealand. We are the only chain to cover NZ from Whangarei to Invercargill with professionally owned and managed music stores. It was our belief that MusicWorks stores would always provide world renowned brands and offer a level of professionalism and customer service that was second to none. We had identified that sadly this was lacking in the NZ music scene. Whilst 20 of the 32 stores are individually owned, all stores actively contribute and participate in the marketing of the group and as part of their supply agreement, ensure that the majority of their stock is MusicWorks imported product which they have the ability to buy at better prices, and pass those savings on to their customers. This structure also gives the brands we represent the best possible platform from which to market their products in New Zealand.

                    MusicWorks Limited represents many of the worlds leading brands with which we have exclusive importing agreements with including Yamaha - the largest manufacturer in the world, as well as Tama Drums and Ibanez Guitars, two of the worlds leading rock brands, and Ashton - the premier entry level brand in the Australasian music market. Paiste, Schecter Guitars, Beale, Hiwatt, Laney and Steinberg are but an example of the brands that we import and distribute in New Zealand. In addition to this our stores offer a significant range of other world renowned brands to the consumer such as Maton Guitars and Martin Guitars.

                    The size of the company means that we can negotiate great deals from our New Zealand suppliers of brands we don't import as well, so that we can offer value for money to our customers and not just for our own imported brands. MusicWorks has specialist staff covering all areas of the music industry, we have a Professional Audio division which caters specifically to the professional recording, installation, theatre and hire market. Our service department includes two full-time, factory trained technicians, as well as a number of Guitar Repairers and Luthiers spread throughout the country with access to factory direct parts to ensure our service and backup is second to none.

                    All of our staff are passionate about the music industry and ensuring MusicWorks stores provide the customer with a total solution. Our philosophy is simple. Import the best brands in bulk, ensure that they are well promoted throughout New Zealand through a mixture of mediums such as nationwide mail outs, TV, Internet, Newspaper and specialty publications unique to the music industry, and to ensure that the NZ public is getting the best value for money when they purchase from a MusicWorks store.
